# About
My personal Discord bot written out of boredom and lack of creativity.

This project started on October 23, 2018.
During this time my understanding of dependency injection wasn't solid,
this mixed with laziness and neglect has resulted in the design and structure of this project
to be very questionable and all over the place.
Maybe one day I'll get around to cleaning it all up, maybe.
Until then though I'm just gonna keep adding to it.
